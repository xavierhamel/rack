# String utility functions

# Will return the index of a given char in a string. This function will pop 2
# arguments, the first is the charater to find in the string and the second is
# the address of the string to search. If no match is found, -1 is returned
# 
fn str::find_char[int, str|ptr -> int]
    0 swap str::find_char_from
end

# Will return the index of a given char in a string. This function will pop 2

# USAGE:
#   std::find_char_from(char, starting_idx, str -> idx)
fn str::find_char_from[int, int, str|ptr -> int]
    _rk_char put
    over +
    while dup load8 _rk_char! != over load8 0 != & do

# Will return the length of the c-string at the given address. This function will
# pop one argument, the address of the string and push back the length of the
# string. Check for the null terminating byte to count the length.
# USAGE:
#   str::len(str) -> int
fn str::len[str|ptr -> int]
    0 str::find_char
end

# Alias for `std::print_str`
fn str::print[str|ptr -> void]
    std::print_str
